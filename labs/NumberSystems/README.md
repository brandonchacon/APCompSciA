# Number Systems
In this lab you will write programs to convert numbers from one base to another 

## Introduction
You have been learning how to represent numbers in different bases - decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal.  In this lab you will combine the power of loops to write a program to convert a number from one base to another. 

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "Number Systems" lab guide [NumberSystems.pdf](NumberSystems.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* In your AP Computer Science A Repo on your computer make sure you have created a directory called "labs"
	* Inside your labs directory, create another directory called "NumberSystems"
	* Complete the challenges below
	* Once you have completed your challenges push your AP Computer Science A Repo to GitHub
	* Show your completed challenges to Ms. Pluska to receive credit for the individual portion of this lab

### Challenge 1

- [ ] Write a program that prompts the user for a number base (2 thru 9) and a corresponding number, then converts the number to decimal

### Challenge 2

- [ ] Write a program that prompts the user for a decimal number and a number base (2 thru 9), then converts the number to the indicated number base

### Extra Credit

- [ ] Expand your program to accept: 
	* A base to convert from (2 thru hexadecimal)
	* A base to convert to (2 thru hexadecimal)
	* A number
	* Then convert the number to the indicated number base
