# for-loops
In this lab you will learn how for-loops can be applied to solve a variety of problems. 

## Introduction
In this lab you will apply _for-loops_ to develop a palindrome checker for both Strings and numbers.  You will also apply nested _for-loops_ to create patterns on a grid. 

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "for-loops" lab guide [ForLoops.pdf](ForLoops.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* In your AP Computer Science A Repo on your computer make sure you have created a directory called "labs"
	* Inside your labs directory, create another directory called "ForLoops"
	* Complete the challenges below
	* Once you have completed your challenges push your AP Computer Science A Repo to GitHub
	* Show your completed challenges to Ms. Pluska to receive credit for the individual portion of this lab

### Challenge 1

- [ ] Implement the palindrome checker for words.  Your program must prompt the user for a word.  If the word is a palindrome, print "Palindrome!" to the consol, otherwise print "No!"

### Challenge 2

- [ ] Implement the palindrome checker for numbers.  Your program must prompt the user for a number.  If the number is a palindrome, print "Palindrome!" to the consol, otherwise print "No!"

### Challenge 3

- [ ]  Locate the file [ForLoops.java](ForLoops.java) and import this into Netbeans.  Write code to complete the following, 

	* Horizontal stripes
	* Vertical strips

### Extra Credit

- [ ] Implement the following, 
	* A checkered grid
	* A checkerer grid where only the top right half is filled (see lab guide for example)
	* A checkerer grid where only the top left half is filled  (see lab guide for example)
	* A checkered grid where only the bottom left half is filled (see lab guide for example)
	* A checkered grid where only the bottom right half is filled (see lab guide for example)
