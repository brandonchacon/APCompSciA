# String Operations

## Introduction
In this lab you will apply numerical operations to perform calculation and print the results to the console

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "Numberical Operations" lab guide [NumericalOperations.pdf](NumericalOperations.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* In your AP Computer Science A Repo on your computer make sure you have created a directory called "labs"
	* Inside your labs directory, create another directory called "NumericalOperations"
	* Inside the directory you just created, create a java file called NumericalOperations.java
	* Implement the challenges below
	* Once you have completed your challenges push your AP Computer Science A Repo to GitHub
	* Show your completed challenge to Ms. Pluska to receive credit for the individual portion of this lab

### Challenge 1

- [ ] Consider the code below.  Predict the result of each of the following numeric operations

double d1 = 37.9;
double d2 = 1004.128;
int i1 = 12;
int i2 = 18;

|  problem | predicted answer  |
|---|---|
| 57.2 * (i1 / i2) + 1  |   |
| 57.2 * ((double)i1 / i2) + 1  |   |
| 15 – i1 * (d1 * 3) + 4  |  |
| 15 – i1 * ((int)d1 * 3) + 4  |  |
| 15 – i1 * (int)(d1 * 3) + 4  |  |

- [ ] Print the result to each of the above problems to the console.  Do they match your prediction?

### Challenge 2

- [ ] Implement the number reversal code you wrote in the group portion of this lab.  Your code should work for any 4 digit integer.  When your code is ran the original and the reversed number should print to the console.  Consider the examples below, 

|  number | result  |
|---|---|
| 1234  | 1234 --> 4321  |
| 6789  | 6789 --> 9876  |
| 1080  | 1080 --> 0801  |
