    <p>Recall that the assignment operator is the standard equal sign (=) and is used to “assign” a value to a
        variable.</p>
    <p>Consider the following example,  </p> 

    <p class="codeblock">
    int i = 3; //<b>OK.</b> Assigns the value of 3 to i.  Notice the direction of data flow.<br>
    3 = i; //<b>Illegal.  Data does not flow this way. </b><br>
    double p;<br>
    double j = 47.12;<br>
    p = j; //<b>OK.</b> Assigns the value of j to p.  Both p and j are now equal to 47.12
    </p>

    <p>
    It is possible to declare several variables of the same type on one line.  In the below example, i, x, y, and z are all 
    declared as int type variables.  

    </p>
    <p class="codeblock">
    int i, x, y, z;
    </p>

    <p>
    We can also declare and initialize variables on one line.  In the example below, w and j, are both declared and initialized.  g however
    is just declared.  
    </p>
    <p class="codeblock">
    int w = 1000, j = 2000, g;

            <p>Examples of how each of the above operators can be applied are illustrated below,</p>
            <p><u>Addition</u></p>
            <p class="codeblock">
                int x = 1;<br>
                int y = 2;<br>
                int z = x + y;//3 is assigned to z<br>
                x = x + z;//4 is re-assigned to x<br>
                System.out.println(z);//3 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x + y);//6 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x + 10);//14 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(10 + 10);//20 is printed to the console
            </p>
            <p><u>Subtraction</u></p>
            <p class="codeblock">
                int x = 1;<br>
                int y = 2;<br>
                int z = x - y;//-1 is assigned to z<br>
                x = x - z;//0 is re-assigned to x<br>  
                System.out.println(z);//-1 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x - y);//-2 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x - 10);//-10 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(10 - 10);//0 is printed to the console
            </p>
            <p><u>Multiplication</u></p>
            <p class="codeblock">
                int x = 1;<br>
                int y = 2;<br>
                int z = x * y;//2 is assigned to z<br>
                x = x * z;//2 is re-assigned to x<br>
                System.out.println(z);//2 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x * y);//4 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x * 10);//20 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(10 * 10);//100 is printed to the console
            </p>
            <p><u>Division</u></p>
            <p>The below example illustrates how int type variables are treated.  If the result of the 
                division is a fraction, the decimal places are "cut off" - <b>int variable types do not round</b>. 
            </p>
            <p class="codeblock">
                int x = 1;<br>
                int y = 2;<br>
                int z = y/x;//2 is assigned to z<br>
                x = z/x;//2 is re-assigned to x<br>
                System.out.println(z);//2 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x/y);//1 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x/10);//0 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(10/10);//1 is printed to the console
            </p>
            <p><u>Modulus</u></p>
            <p>Modulus prints the remainder of a division operation. For example, System.out.println(5%3);
                will print 2. This is because when 5 is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. Modulus gives the
                remainder. Modulus also handles negatives. The answer to a%b has the same sign as a. The
                sign of b is ignored.</b>. 
            </p>
            <p class="codeblock">
                int x = 1;<br>
                int y = 2;<br>
                int z = x%y;//1 is assigned to z<br>
                x = x%z;//0 is re-assigned to x<br>
                System.out.println(z);//1 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x%y);//0 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(x%10);//0 is printed to the console<br>
                System.out.println(10/10);//0 is printed to the console

<div id="skill3" class="skills">Skill 3.3 Apply unary operators</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 3.3 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
        <p>The unary operators  are operations that require only one operand; 
            they perform various operations such as incrementing/decrementing a value by one, 
            negating an expression, or inverting the value of a boolean. 
        </p>
        <u>Incrementing a value by 1</u>
        <p>The code below illustrates how to increment the variable x by 1</p>
        <p class="codeblock">
            int x = 1;<br>
            x = x + 1;//x is now 2
        </p>

        <p>Incrementing a value by 1 can also be done using the <i>++</i> operator,</p>
        <p class="codeblock">
            int x = 1;<br>
            System.out.println(x++);//1 is printed to the consol, <b>then</b> x is incremented <br>
            System.out.println(++x);//x is incremented first, then it's value, 3, is printed to the consol.
        </p>
        <p>Notice in the above example that <i>++</i> can come before or after the variable.  
        If it comes <i>before</i> the variable, the variable is first incremented then printed.  
        If it comes <i>after</i> the variable, the variable is first printed then incremented.</p>
        <u>Decrementing a value by 1</u>
        <p>The code below illustrates how to decrement the variable y by 1</p>
        <p class="codeblock">
            int y = 10;<br>
            y = y - 1;//y is now 9
        </p>

        <p>Decrementing a value by 1 can also be done using the <i>--</i> operator,</p>
        <p class="codeblock">
            int y = 10;<br>
            System.out.println(y--);//10 is printed to the consol, <b>then</b> y is decremented <br>
            System.out.println(--y);//y is decremented first, then it's value, 8, is printed to the consol
        </p>
        <p>Notice in the above example that <i>--</i> can come before or after the variable.  
            If it comes <i>before</i> the variable, the variable is first decremented then printed.  
            If it comes <i>after</i> the variable, the variable is first printed then decremented.</p>

    <div id="skill4" class="skills">3.4 Apply compound operators </div>
    <div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 3.4 Concepts</div>
    <div class="skillConcepts">
     <p>A compound assignment operator is an operator that performs a calculation 
         and an assignment at the same time. In the below example, x can be re-assigned explicitely
         using <i>x = x + 5</i>; x can also be re-assigned using the addition compound operator. 
     </p>
     <p class="codeblock">
            int x = 10;<br>
            x = x + 5;//x is 15<br>
            x += 5;//x is now 20
     </p>
     <p>Compound operators can be applied to all the arithmetic operations.  How this is done
         is illustrated below,

<div id="skill5" class="skills">3.5 Apply PEMDAS to arithmetic operations</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 3.5 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
 <p>The algebra rule, PEMDAS, applies to computer computations as well. (PEMDAS stands for the
        order in numeric operations are done. P = parenthesis, E = exponents, M = multiply, D = divide,
        A = add, S = subtract. Actually M and D have equal precedence, as do A and S. For equal
        precedence operation, proceed from left to right. A mnemonic for PEMDAS is, “Please Excuse
        My Dear Aunt Sally)
 </p>
 <p>The example below illustrates PEMDAS</p>
 <p class="codeblock">
        System.out.println(5 + 3 * 4 – 7); //prints out 10<br>
        System.out.printly(8 – 5 * 6 / 3 + (5 – 6) * 3); //prints out -5
